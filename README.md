### README

Pretty basic tool. Very simple.

PNG Files must be in the format image_name_xxxxx.png

Note that the x's represent five numbers. This is required and can
be adjusted in the export settings of Photoshop and After Effects.

Execute by sending it the first frame as an argument. The first frame must be zero.

The last argument is the number of frames.

python image-lineup.py image_name_00000.png 20




I'm always open to suggestions and requests. It's a super basic tool that I wrote
during a project at work. Definitely room for improvement.
